ToneMatrix is a 16-step drum machine. The Y (vertical) axis
represents eight different sounds, and more than one can be
played at a time. The X (horizontal) axis represents one
4/4 measure in sixteenth-notes.

Select a node on the grid with the D-pad and the X button,
and that sound will be played in time. Press O to stop/
resume playing. Press [] (square) to mute the row the cursor
is on. Press /\ (triangle) to mute every row except the
row the cursor is on. You can mute more than one row at
once.

Press START to use the menu, and use the D-pad to select a
menu item or change a value (like the tempo), and X (cross)
to confirm your choice. Press SELECT for help.

You can play up to twelve measures in a row by using the R
and L triggers, or by switching the "grid" value in the
START mneu. If "loop all" is on, then the measures will
play one after another. If it is off, it will only repeat
one measure. It is recommended that you stop playback
before editing another grid.

To install:
If you have custom firmware or a homebrew-enabled PSP,
place the "unsigned" folder into the /PSP/GAME folder on
your Memory Stick. If you have official firmware on your PSP
(or if you have a PSPgo), place the "signed" folder into the
/PSP/GAME folder on your Memory Stick.
